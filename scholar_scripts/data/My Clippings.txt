A machine learning approach, of which ANNs were one technique.  the author screws this up and i am not confident that it is a intentional simplification.  he also says that Deep networks are a new theoretical breakthrough, while actual pioneers and anyone familiar will see that the are the same ANNs from the 80s but with compounded computing power from moores law effect.  damaging authors credibility

Okay, i seriously doubt this but we will see.  silicon valley is an engineering, i.e. Implementing, culture, not a cambridge like theoretical research area.  so chinas only edge is in access to more chinezs data, whcih wouls be easily offset by a group of countries implementing a shared data pool.  that would be more diverzs data as well

That global shift is the product of two transitions: from the age of discovery to the age of implementation, and from the age of expertise to the age of data.

States that we are in an implementation ony phase but then cites limited basis research funding as a USA limitation?  hopefully he acknowledges that uSA can pull from a global talent (engineer, entrepreneurs, and scientists) pool, including Chinas.  China isnt even particularly Attractive to all Chinese, from what i can tell (i am prone to propaganda here)
